ABOUT 
=====
CommandLine::OptionParser is part of the CommandLine suite of
tools and is used for command line parsing. The command line
parser suite consists of classes CommandLine::Option, 
CommandLine::OptionData and CommandLine::Application.

The parser supports POSIX, Gnu and XTools style parsing options. 
It also provides flexibility to support <em>non standard</em>
options. For example:

POSIX
=====
OptionParser.new Option.new(:posix, :names => "-f")

Gnu
===
OptionParser.new Option.new(:names => %w[--file -f])

XTools
======
OptionParser.new Option.new(:names => "-file")

User
====
OptionParser.new(Option.new(
   :names => %w(--file -file --files -files -f),
   :arg_arity => [1,-1],
   :arg_description => "file1 [file2, ...]"))

This last option prints:

 OPTIONS

     --file,-file,--files,-files,-f file1 [file2, ...]


HISTORY
=======
After poking around in a few corporations, it was evident that
option parsing was not well understood. Therefore, many inhouse
tools were built that did not conform to any of the POSIX, Gnu or XTools
option styles. CommandLine::OptionParser was developed so that
new applications could be written that conformed to accepted standards,
but non-standard option configurations could be handled as well
to support legacy interfaces.
